[Basic-Bot.py](./Basic-Bot.py) - A very rudimentary template for Discord Bots. 

[PingBot-3000.py](./PingBot-3000.py) - A bot designed to cause great annoyance on any Discord Server on April Fools. Whenever a use sends a message with almost any key, the bot pings them. 
    
- A new variant of the PingBot-3000 will soon be added that pings everyone anytime someone says something.
